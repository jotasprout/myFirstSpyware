While working on securing my home network, I've started to pay much closer attention to each device, what they can do, and how they're vulnerable.
Being able to ask Alex to lock my doors and vacuum the living room (via the Roomba) is all well and good until someone else can unlock my doors or access my credit card information at Amazon through my Roomba. 

Remote command and control camera via smartwatch

This little remote came with my ringlight. It only does one thing -- takes a picture with the default photo app on either an iPhone or Android phone. It just needs to be paired via bluetooth.

This is my smartwatch Software Development Kit. It uses BLE.

I want to reverse-engineer the remote fob. Shouldn't be too difficult. Might be just as easy to just create my own identical app for my phone.

With a little social engineering (IF they have a password), one could pair a watch with anyone's phone and take a picture remotely, right?

It took over 40 years but the little boy who watched Wargames and wanted to be James Bond is on his way.
